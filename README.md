> ring http server for cljd

**aim** aims to be a simple, small HTTP server for clojure-dart.

It uses [dart.io.HttpServer](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.17.1/dart-io/HttpServer-class.html)
converts [dart.io.HttpRequest](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.17.1/dart-io/HttpRequest-class.html) into ring-requests and
ring-responses into [dart.io.HttpResponse](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.17.1/dart-io/HttpResponse-class.html)

This is still in progress.

There is no public API yet.
